## How to read the slides

New slides are written in Markdown and have the PDF version attached.

Older slides were written in Swift, you could either:
- Some of them have PDF versions, which might be easier to deal with
- Or, read the Swift source of the slides
- Or, open `slides.swift` with [Truffaut](https://github.com/Codezerker/Truffaut) (the tool is longer maintained, so probably won't work).
